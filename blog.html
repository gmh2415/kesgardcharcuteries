			<h1>My Favorite Products to Use on a Board February 13th, 2022</h1>
			
			<p>The fun thing about creating and decorating charcuterie boards are the endless products you can use on the boards. Whether it is a fun dip, jam, or spread or a new cracker you found, there are endless possibilites to what a board can look like. Below I share what my favorite products to use are.
			
			<p>1. Divina Fig Spread</p>
			<p> This spread is full of flavor! Although figs tend to turn some people off Divina's fig spread is rich in carmel flavors which pairs wonderfully with cheese and wine!</p>
			
			<p>2. Texas Pepper Works Candy Crisp Jalapenos</p>
			<p> These Jalapenos bring sweet and spicy together in the perfect mix! Not only do I love using these on my charcuterie boards, but I love them as a snack as well with some cream cheese on a cracker.</p>
			
			<p>3. Trader Joes Roasted & Salted Truffle Marcona Almonds</p>
			<p> I LOVE truffle. Whether its truffle oil fries, pasta, or in this case nuts! These are perfect for snacking on and bring an interesting flavor to the board.</p>
			
			<p>4. Robert Rothschild Farm Raspberry Honey Mustard Dip and Glaze</p>
			<p> There is this little shop in the town of Leavenworth, WA that lets you test more than 20 different mustards, honeys, and jams. Using a mustard on my board brings that nostalgia back, a comfort caused by both food and memory.</p>
			
			<p>5. La Panzanella Rosemary Crackers</p>
			<p> These crackers are something I've used for years. My mom use to use these on her charcuterie boards and I have carried on the tradition. They are so simple, yet so flavorful and are paired well with any cheese!</p>
